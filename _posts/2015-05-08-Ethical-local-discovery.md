title: Ethical local discovery
---
Can we support local discovery for opportunistic synching without violating our user's [privacy rights](http://www.goland.org/localdiscoverybillofrights/)? We have written [an article](http://thaliproject.org/presenceprotocolforopportunisticsynching) and provided [sample code](https://github.com/yaronyg/cryptopresencetest) implementing a proposal for how to address this problem in a way that meets our perf/bandwidth needs but still reasonably protects user privacy. The proposal isn't complete but the immediate goal is to get feedback on the general approach.
