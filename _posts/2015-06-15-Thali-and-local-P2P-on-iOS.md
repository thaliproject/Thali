I put together an [article](http://thaliproject.org/iosp2p) on the choices Thali is making for local P2P on iOS. By local P2P I mean P2P using local radios, e.g. BLE, Bluetooth and various flavors of Wi-Fi. This article explains what the options are on the iOS platform, what challenges those options present and how we are trying to address them.
