We have been evaluating what we think is potentially an awesome solution to running node.js on mobile platforms, [JXCore](http://jxcore.com/home/). We have captured a bunch of our investigation in [a FAQ on JXCore](http://www.goland.org/jxcore/) and also have a stand alone article that just looks at [JXCore's performance on mobile](http://www.goland.org/jxcoreperf/).
