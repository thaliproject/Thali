title: Thali Story 0 - The lights are officially on!
---
Story 0 includes (in rough form) most of the major technologies needed to make Thali go including Android and iOS local discovery and 
connectivity, [JXcore](https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore),  [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/),
[JXcore for Cordova](https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore-cordova) and [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/). 
See [here](http://www.goland.org/story0/) for details! You can get the sample app [here](https://github.com/thaliproject/postcardapp).
Tons more work to do but this is an exciting step!
