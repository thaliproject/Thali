title: Wi-Fi-Direct on Android, issues and workarounds
---
Wi-Fi Direct, is a Wi-Fi standard enabling devices to easily connect with each other without requiring a wireless access point, and thus would be good candidate for Thali in situation where normal networks are not available, 
and still we would need to get data synchronized between devices. The Android API for Wi-Fi-Direct have been available quite awhile, but supposedly has some issues, thus we set up on doing tests on how it works.

The initial investigation for the API issues and workarounds are available at the [blog article](http://www.drjukka.com/blog/wordpress/?p=24)
