title: Data speed test results for Bt-connector library
---
Bluetooth connections between Android devices are often unreliable so I measured "effective" speeds over Bluetooth, that is, how fast can you move data when you take regular connection failures into consideration. The results are available in my [blog article](http://www.drjukka.com/blog/wordpress/?p=100)
