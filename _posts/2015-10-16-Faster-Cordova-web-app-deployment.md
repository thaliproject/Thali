Building Cordova apps just to debug web app updates on device can be very time consuming. So I thought it would be a good idea to make a script to inject the changes into the app package and deploy to device.
See how much time we saved building and deploying our Postcard app to an iOS device on my [dev blog](http://www.deadlyfingers.net/mobile/faster-cordova-web-app-deployment-with-hotwire-script/).
