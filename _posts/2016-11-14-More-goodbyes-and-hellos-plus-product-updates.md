title: More goodbyes and hellos plus product updates
---

At the start of this month [Alexander Evsyuchenya](https://github.com/baydet) said goodbye to the Thali project. You can read a summary of his outstanding contributions to Thali in our [Alumni Page](http://thaliproject.org/Alumni/). Also make sure to catch his article on the [Multi-Peer Connectivity Framework](https://medium.com/@baydet/dark-corners-of-multipeer-connectivity-framework-abd566422920#.l3o9dbley) which captures some hard earned lessons.

Replacing Alex on our iOS team is Alex. In this case [Alexander Telegin](https://github.com/drinkius) who joined on 10/21/2016. He is already contributing by helping us to move to Swift 3 and doing some deep dive investigations into what we can do with BLE on iOS (on iOS 10 it looks like we can run as both a central and a peripheral in the background!). 

Also joining the team for just one month is our Node.js intern, [Igor Serzhan](https://github.com/squid48). Igor joined on 10/31/2016 and already has several PRs to help us support iOS at the node layer under his belt.

In further fun I just came back from [Rockwell's Automation Fair](http://www.controlglobal.com/articles/2016/live-from-rockwell-automation-fair-2016/) in Atlanta Georgia where Rockwell officially announced TeamONE (formerly Project Stanton) and yes they announced [Thali Support!](http://origin-www.rockwellautomation.com/resources/pdf/rockwellsoftware/product-pages/FactoryTalk-TeamONE-pricing-guide-2016.pdf) Although it doesn't ship until next year.

Right now we have Wifi mode on both Android and iOS working well and we also have Bluetooth/BLE support on Android working well. If you want to play with them probably the easiest way to start is to head over to https://github.com/thaliproject/thaliTestApp and give it a try! 

We should have iOS Multi-peer Connectivity Support ready in a few weeks. All the native code is done and fully tested. We are just finishing up integrating it into our Node code.
