title: Serval and Thali

[http://www.goland.org/serval_and_thali/](http://www.goland.org/serval_and_thali/) - I have been following the Serval project for several years now with the hope that they would solve Thali's radio problems. For a variety of reasons that wasn't possible in Serval's early days but now things are progressing and I'd love to see what is possible. I've written the previously linked article in order to get myself re-aquainted with Serval and to compare and contrast how Serval and Thali work. My plan is to talk to Paul Gardner-Stephen the lead on Serval to see if we can figure things out.
