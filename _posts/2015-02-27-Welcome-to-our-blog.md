The folks involved with Thali all have their own blogs and we tend to post things about Thali there. For example, Yaron (me) has a whole channel on his blog about Thali available [here](http://www.goland.org/category/technology/thali/). In the future however we will also include links to those blogs and other relevant material here so those interested in tracking Thali can follow us in one place.

Note that if you are really interested in Thali we also recommend subscribing to our mailing list [here](https://pairlist10.pair.net/mailman/listinfo/thali-talk).
