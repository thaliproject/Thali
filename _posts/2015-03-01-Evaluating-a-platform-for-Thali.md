title: How do we figure out if a potential platform can handle Thali?

We just put together a [check list](/PlatformChecklist) of requirements for what a platform needs to be able to do in order to run Thali. We are using this to evaluate how to run node.js on various platforms as well as figuring out which platforms have the capabilities that Thali needs to 'do its thing'.
