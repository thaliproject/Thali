title: Saying thank you and good bye to old friends and welcoming a bunch of new faces to Thali
---
Microsoft had agreed to incubate Thali until around April of this year. So team members assigned to the project all more or less left at that point. I've updated our [alumni page](http://thaliproject.org/Alumni/) to cover them all and describe their accomplishments. New entries are included for David Douglas, Matthew Podwysocki, Oguz Bastemur, Shawn Cicoria, Toby Bradshaw and Tomi Paanananen. I wax on quite a bit there about what they did and why we are greatful. So a big thank you to all of you!

Rockwell Automation has brought on board a bunch of new folks to work on Thali. Some are Rockwell Automation employees but many are working through two companies that Rockwell has brought on board, Hiqo and Janea.
