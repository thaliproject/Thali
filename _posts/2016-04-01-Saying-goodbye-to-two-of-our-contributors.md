title: Saying goodbye to two of our contributors
---
What is awesome about being incubated by the [Microsoft Partner Catalyst Team](http://catalystcode.github.io/case-studies/) (PCT) is that you get to work with amazing people. But as an incubation/proof of concept group all assignments are temporary, anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. At the end of this week two of our contributors finished their work on Thali, specifically Juhana Ilari Sakari Koski and Ville Rantala. Both made significant contributions to Thali and both will be missed on Thali. To learn more about the awesome things they have done check out their entries on our [Alumni page](http://thaliproject.org/Alumni/).
