## Contributing Code

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team on the discussion list to make sure it's something that fits our goals and direction. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Thali team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.
