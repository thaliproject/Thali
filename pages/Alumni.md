The main group at Microsoft that works on Thali uses an agile model where we can pull in resources as we need them. This means we don't have a standing team for Thali. Therefore the purpose of this page is to honor the folks who have contributed to Thali.

[Jon Udell](http://blog.jonudell.net/)  - Thali's first PM, first advocate and first user!

We had what I jokingly called a "summer of code" like event back in 2014 and the following folks spent a few weeks helping Thali out. They worked on our now depricated Java codebase which is why you don't really see their contributions. But it is because of their contributions that we were able to convince our senior management that this Thali thing could work which then led to them wanting Thali on more than just Java which led to our work on Node.js. So in a sense they wrote their own code out of a job.

[Stefan Gordon](http://www.stefangordon.com/) - He single handedly got our Crosswalk based HTML front end working on Android and then put together the NanoHTTPD infrastructure that let us host our content on the desktop in the browser.

[Ivan Judson](http://irjudson.org/) - He wrote our first Javascript/PouchDB based address book, was the first guinea pig for Stefan's work and managed to survive the awful hell of trying to scan QR Codes in Javascript.

[James Spring](http://www.innerdot.com/) - He hacked into both the Javascript and the Java replication code so that we could manage replication between devices in a way that didn't instantly crash. This was a huge deal for our demo.

[Jason Poon](http://www.jasonpoon.ca/) - Jason got Jenkins running in Azure so we could start doing cross platform testing and also worked a bit on getting Jenkins running locally.

[Tim Park](https://twitter.com/timpark) - He wrote the demo that convinced our upper management that someone other than me could actually use Thali! His deliver was a big part of getting us funded!

For just over a month we had the awesome help of [Wenhui Lu](https://twitter.com/ui_lu) who had a really hard job to do that we can't really talk about yet, but he did it well and without complaint. We are greatful!

[Brian Lambert](http://www.softwarenerd.org/) - Brian created the foundation of our iOS code including figuring out how the heck to make BLE centrals work in the background, how to get an iPhone to be both a central and a peripheral at the same time and how to integrate the multipeer connectivity framework. He also was the original designer of the native API we use to communicate from JXCore/Node.js to native code and debugged through a lot of tricky issues in the early days of JXCore's native plugin api on iOS. He still helps out from time to time but now has moved on to lead his own project.
